Student Directory
=================


The student directory script allows you to manage the list of students enrolled on the course at Makers Academy. 


How to use
-----------
To use the basic student directory (Week 1 exercise):
```shell
ruby directory.rb
```

Extra challenge for week 1, the program will print the January cohort student(s) whose name begins with a specified letter and a specified number of characters:
```shell
ruby directory-ex3-ex4.rb
```

To use student directory pro (Week 2):
```shell
ruby directory-pro.rb
```
